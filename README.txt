One of my Free code camp projects, a tic-tac-toe game. At the moment it's still in development. In this repository you can find the version 2.0, wich features a fully functional multiplayer mode and single player mode. One should note, the IA on this game is pretty basic. It just plays as an "amateur" tic-tac-toe player would: if thereÂ´s an obvious play, it does that, if not it just makes a random one. 

Note: this app doesn't do well on mobile devices.

You can try it out live here: conderodrigo98.github.io/tic-tac-toe
