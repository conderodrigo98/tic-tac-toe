One of my Free code camp projects, a tic-tac-toe game. At the moment it's still in development. In this repository you can find the version 1.0, wich features a fully functional multiplayer mode. For next version I plan on adding a single player mode and the hability of chosing if you want to play with X or O.

You can try it out live here: conderodrigo98.github.io/tic-tac-toe
